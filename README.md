## Introduction
This is a ecommerce store that displays products using the data from DummyJSON API which is great resource to showcase frontend development. 
I enjoy building the project as it really helped me to understand the importance of using Typescript and really understand the data that I am 
using in my project.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React, TypScript, TailwindCSS, Component Library: DaisyUI
- **Backend**: DummyJSON API, Custom Hooks, Type Definitions
- **APIs**: Dummy JSON API
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Features

- Product List: View a comprehensive list of products.
- Product Details: Access detailed information about each product, including biography, achievements, and historical significance.
- User Interface: Designed for ease of navigation with a user-friendly interface.
- Integration: Connected with Historical Figures API and Wiki API for accurate and up-to-date information.

## What I learnt
- Type Definition: Created TypeScript definitions (e.g., Products.d.ts) to ensure type safety and reduce errors when fetching and using data from APIs.

- Custom Hooks: Developed custom hooks (e.g., useProduct) to handle data fetching and state management efficiently.

- Responsiveness: Applied TailwindCSS for creating a responsive and visually appealing design.
